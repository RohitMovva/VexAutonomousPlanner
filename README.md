## Setup
Run from source code or excecutables in the Actions tab

After running the project, a file selector will open, select the parent folder of the routes.h file. After this another file selector will open, select what folder you would like the paths (these are not the {velocity, heading} pairs but rather a list of coordinates of the points and data related to those points) to save to, if you are running the code directly this will already exist as the "routes" folder. If not running the code direclty I recommend creating one yourself and selecting that.

## File management
I recommend using the "Set Current Working File" button every time you open the project, doing this will make sure the changes you make are auto saved and the route will auto update in the routes.h header file.
