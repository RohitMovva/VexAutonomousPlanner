# VexAutonomousPlanner

An application for easy, action oriented, generation of paths for VEX robotics.

Created by team 77717F Flip

## Features
- Create, move, and delete nodes to create paths
- Paths are created using auto generated quintic Hermite splines (no need to deal with control points)
- Assign custom actions to nodes, such as turn, wait, reverse, and more
- Generate a 2d motion profile of the path
- View graphs generated by the 2d motion profile including position, velocity, heading, etc...
- Store the motion profile to a header file to use in your own codebase

## Installation
The project can be accessed either by cloning or by downloading the latest excecutable from the Releases tab on the side. (Project is still in heavy development)

On the first run of the application you will be prompted to select a "routes" folder, this is just a folder where paths you generate will be stored. You will also be prompted to select another folder to save the 2d motion profile generated based on the path, which can be used in combination with a controller of your choice whether that be PID, Pure Pursuit, Ramsete, or something else.

## Contribution and Collaboration
Currently the project is currently solely maintained and written by team 77717F. If interested in contributing or if you have any other questions or suggestions feel free to reach out to me on Discord (communistpoultry).
