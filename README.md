# VexAutonomousPlanner

An application for easy, action oriented, generation of paths for VEX robotics.

Created by team 77717A Flip

## Installation
The project can be accessed either by cloning or by downloading the latest excecutable from the Releases tab on the side.

On the first run of the application you will be prompted to select a "routes" folder, this is just a folder where paths you generate will be stored. You will also be prompted to select another folder to save the path in vector form ({x, y, heading}), which can be used in combination with a feedback loop (like PID) to control the robot itself.
